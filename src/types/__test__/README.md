# Type Tests

These tests use [dtslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint) to make sure there are no type errors for users of the library.

Quality of error messages and type names displayed can obviously not be tested. To check these manually, simply open the files in VS Code and hover over the variables and errors.
