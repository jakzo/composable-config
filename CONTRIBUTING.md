# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

If you're unsure about whether you should add a feature or have a question about how it should be done, just open an issue.

The commit hooks (`npm test`) should ensure automated quality standards are met. Other than that, just remember to use [tsdoc](https://github.com/Microsoft/tsdoc) comments liberally. Comments and readmes in the source should explain how things work so I don't have to here. ðŸ™‚
